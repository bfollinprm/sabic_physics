{\bf Problem 1.}(12 points.) Short answer--no more than one sentence each. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item If $\vec{C} = \vec{A} + \vec{B}$ and $|C| = |A| + |B|$, then what must be true about $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$?

\item A dripping shower faucet releases drops at a rate of 10 per second (or one drop every $0.1$s). Find the seperation (difference in height) between two consecutive drops when (i) the topmost drop just leaves the faucet, and (ii) when the bottommost drop is $1$m below the faucet.

At its maximum height, object $B$ has a potential energy of $100$J. What is the gravitational potential energy of object $A$ at its own maximum height?

{\bf Problem 4.}() (Energy and motion in a circle)
A small block with a mass of $0.06$kg is attached to a cord passing through a hole in a frictionless, horizontal surface (see figure), which you hold with your hand. The block is originally revolving at a distance of $0.4$m from the holes with a speed of $0.70$m/s.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Calculate the tension on the string.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\item How much work is done by this tension force to keep the block revolving in a circle?
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\item You then pull the string, shortening the radius of the circle in which the block revolves to $0.1$m, and increasing its speed to $2.8$m/s. Calculate the new tension of the cord.

\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\bigskip
\item How much work did you do to shorten the radius of the circle?
